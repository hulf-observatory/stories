          <p>Between March 30, 2025, and April 3, 2025, a deforestation drive was undertaken in Kancha Gachibowli Forest. We have conducted a quick assessment to map the extent of deforestation and land area that was disturbed in those four days.</p>

          <p>This analysis focuses on the observed changes in the Kancha Gachibowli area between late March and early April 2025, based on 10m Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Satellite imagery from March 28, 2025 (pre-deforestation) and April 7, 2025 (post-deforestation) was compared to assess the extent of tree cover loss and land disturbance. The analysis estimates an approximate <strong style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>green cover loss of 102 acres</strong> within the identified boundary, based on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) changes, and an <strong style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>overall land disturbance of about 115 acres</strong>, based on observed surface changes.</p>

          <p>Using the location sketch provided in <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/400-acre-kancha-gachibowli-land-was-not-shown-as-forest-in-revenue-or-forest-records/article69403327.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hindu</a> (accessed on 8 April 2025), we georeferenced the image and digitized the boundary for reference purposes.</p>
